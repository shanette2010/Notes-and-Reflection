# Notes-and-Reflection

## What did I think about video's on JS code?
It was very intersting video's. 

## Was it easy to follow?
It was very easy to follow. But I did have to reply it back a couple of times to make sure I was grasping the concept.

## Did I understand the concept of the videos?
Yes I did eventually!

## What was the difficult part and easy part?
None of the traning videos were very difficult to understand. But it also wasnt easy.
I had to replay it a couple times to make sure I was understandig which plate form this was on (MPM, I still need to download).
Since im more of a hands on learner. The string and commands that caught my eye was,
const sum =addNumber (5,10);/ function addNumber (num2,num2);/ return num1 + numb2;
This function is declaring a constant varible named sum. And is assigning it the value of the function addNumber. 
The numbers or words in () are commands telling it to do something. And the return vaule will add it together.
I thoguht this was pretty neat to learn!
